# DuckSimulator
It is a simple Java project.

Problem Statement:

For this project, students will create a duck simulator.
1. First they have to create a Quackable interface. Some Ducks that implement Quackable
Interface
2. After that they will create an adapter to adapt a goose to a duck.
3. Next for some research purposes we want to count the number of quacks of a duck. They
will create a decorator that gives the ducks this new behavior by wrapping them with a
decorator object.
4. Create a duck factory and a counting duck factory.
5. To create a flock of ducks use a Composite Pattern that allows us to treat a collection of
objects in the same way as individual objects (use an iterator).
6. We also need to track individual ducks. Can you give us a way to keep track of individual
duck quacking in real-time? (use observer)
